          <h3>Danilo</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Danilo (he/him). I was born in Italy and lived most of my
            life in a beautiful village by the lake. I’ve always been a
            daydreamer and growing up I’ve become an idealist and activist. I
            come from a Development and Activism background but my passion for
            justice and enthusiasm for philanthropy and co-operation have taken
            me into the Tech industry I see technology as a medium for enacting
            social change, but I also believe that Tech itself is in serious
            need of upheaval.

          <h3>Sasha</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Sasha (she/her). I am a writer-turned-programmer from
            South London. Tech simultaneously amazes and terrifies me. The way
            that the virtual world has been overlaid on top of the physical is
            the most fascinating thing to happen in generations. Someone with no
            credit rating, no linkedIn, someone whose virtual record was
            accidentally popped off the end of an array can be said to exist
            <em>less</em> than someone who has all of these things, regardless
            of their real-world impact on those around them. I used to find this
            scary but now I find it <em>interesting</em>.

        <h2>About DaSha</h2>
        <p>
          DaSha is a two-person design agency inspired by ideas of degrowth,
          architecture being overrun by nature and failed utopian projects. The
          name 'Dasha' is more than just a concatenation of syllables from our
          respective names: The name 'Dasha' comes from the old persian word
          Darayavaus, meaning 'to maintain posessions.' We believe that the
          correct way to view good maintenence is not to focus on a structure's
          longevity, but how it looks as it begins to decay: Rather than the
          plastic bag lying inert in a landfill for thousands of years we are
          looking to the abandoned powerplants overrun with vines, empty
          concrete tower blocks home to deers and bears for inspiration.
