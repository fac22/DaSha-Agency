        <h3>Danilo</h3>
        <p>

          My name is Danilo (he/him). I was born in Italy and lived most of my life in a beautiful village by the lake.
          I’ve always been a daydreamer and growing up I’ve become an idealist and activist.
          I come from a Development and Activism background but my passion for justice and enthusiasm for philanthropy and co-operation have taken me into the Tech industry
          I see technology as a medium for enacting social change, but I also believe that Tech itself is in serious need of upheaval.

        <h3>Sasha</h3>
        <p>My name is Sasha (she/her). I am a former writer-turned-programmer from South London. Tech simultaneously amazes and terrifies me.
          The way that the virtual world has been overlaid on top of the physical is the most fascinating thing to happen in generations.
          Someone with no credit rating, no linkedIn, someone whose virtual record was accidentally popped off the end of an array can be said to exist <em>less</em> 
          than someone who has all of these things, regardless of their real-world impact on those around them. I used to find this scary but now I find it <em>interesting</em>.
